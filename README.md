### Expositions

#### BIG PROJECT

Frontend, Backend and Database, all in one project!

##### Default choice

Build a dashboard to manage multiple colleges, courses, and students.

##### Backend and database

You will have to have three models, College, Course, and Student.
The backend should have ways to read and modify all of these models.

##### Frontend

The frontend should be a basic page which allows viewing and editing all the information on the backend smoothly.

##### Alternative choice

Build any project you want as long as the database has three or more models.

##### FAQs

- _How do I ask for help?_
  Just go to any instructor in their channel and ask them for help, or send them a private message.
  Feel free to steal Hasan from Abdulrahman any time.

- _How often should we switch navigator and driver?_
  Sense it, there is no strict rules. Make sure it's about 50% each in total.

- _How to use GitHub?_
  Make two different repositories, one for the frontend and one for the backend. Invite your partner as a collaborator so you can both pull and push from the repository smoothly.
